# Product Requirements Document: LLM Design by Contract Framework

## Executive Summary
Build a comprehensive Design by Contract (DbC) framework for Large Language Model APIs that makes implicit assumptions explicit and enforces them throughout the LLM integration lifecycle. The framework will provide input/output validation, temporal contracts, streaming support, and multi-platform compatibility.

## Problem Statement
LLM APIs are notorious for unpredictable behavior leading to subtle bugs:
- Prompts exceeding context length are silently truncated
- Models output malformed text breaking JSON parsers
- Safety filters cause unexpected refusals
- Agent loops get stuck due to format deviations
- ~60% of LLM API issues stem from invalid inputs
- ~20% from output format/content not meeting assumptions

## Core Features

### 1. Contract Taxonomy Implementation
- **Input Contracts**: Preconditions on LLM input (data types, value constraints, prompt length limits)
- **Output Contracts**: Postconditions on responses (format validation, content policy checks)
- **Temporal/Sequence Contracts**: Multi-turn dialogue and agent loop contracts
- **Extended LLM-Specific Contracts**:
  - Semantic consistency contracts (no contradictions across turns)
  - Performance and resource contracts (latency, cost bounds)
  - Security and safety contracts (prompt injection defense)
  - Domain-specific contracts (healthcare disclaimers, financial warnings)

### 2. Framework Architecture
- **Input Validation Stage**: Pre-call validation of all preconditions
- **Output Validation Stage**: Post-call enforcement with auto-remediation
- **Streaming Response Support**: Incremental validation on token streams
- **Multi-turn Conversation Context**: State management across dialogue turns
- **Cross-API Contract Orchestration**: Multi-model pipeline support

### 3. Implementation Roadmap
- **Phase 1**: Minimal prototype with OpenAI API
- **Phase 2**: LangChain integration for orchestration
- **Phase 3**: Multi-platform support (Claude, open-source models)
- **Phase 4**: High-level contract API with decorators

### 4. Contract Specification Language (LLMCL)
- Probabilistic and statistical constraints support
- Semantic and content constraints in logic
- Structural and format constraints
- Temporal logic for multi-turn flows
- Compile-time vs runtime enforcement markings
- Human-readable decorator syntax

### 5. Static and Dynamic Verification
- **Development-time verification**: Contract-aware linters and analyzers
- **Runtime enforcement**: Dynamic checks with low overhead (<20%)
- **Contract-based debugging**: Rich error messages and transparency

### 6. Tooling and Integration
- **IDE Integration**: VS Code plugin with real-time feedback
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions workflow for contract checks
- **Jupyter Notebook Support**: Magic commands for interactive contract enforcement
- **LLMOps Integration**: Monitoring and logging contract violations

### 7. Multi-Platform Support
- OpenAI API (GPT-4, GPT-3.5)
- Anthropic Claude
- Open-source models (HuggingFace, llama.cpp)
- Unified LLM Contracts SDK

## Technical Requirements

### Core Components
1. **Contract Engine**: Core validation and enforcement logic
2. **Provider Adapters**: Abstraction layer for different LLM APIs
3. **Streaming Handler**: Real-time validation for streaming responses
4. **Context Manager**: Multi-turn conversation state tracking
5. **Static Analyzer**: Compile-time contract verification
6. **Runtime Monitor**: Performance and violation tracking

### API Design
```python
@contract
def generate_summary(title: str, content: str) -> str:
    require(len(content) > 0 and len(content) <= MAX_LEN)
    require(title is None or len(title) < 100)
    ensure(is_valid_json(output))
    ensure(sentence_count(output.summary) <= 3)
    ensure_prob(lambda out: title in out.summary, p=0.9)
    return call_llm_api(title, content)
```

### Performance Requirements
- Runtime overhead < 20% of base LLM call latency
- Memory overhead < 50MB for typical applications
- Support for 1000+ requests/second in production

### Security Requirements
- Prompt injection detection and prevention
- Content safety validation
- Secure handling of API keys and sensitive data

## Success Metrics
- **Detection Rate**: Catch 90%+ of known LLM failure patterns
- **Performance Impact**: <20% latency overhead
- **Developer Experience**: Intuitive contract authoring with <10 lines of boilerplate
- **Platform Coverage**: Support for 3+ major LLM providers
- **Adoption**: Seamless integration with existing LLM frameworks

## Deliverables
1. Core contract framework library
2. OpenAI API integration
3. LangChain wrapper and integration
4. Multi-platform adapter system
5. Contract specification language (LLMCL)
6. Static analysis tools
7. VS Code extension
8. CI/CD integration tools
9. Jupyter notebook magics
10. Comprehensive documentation and examples
11. Benchmarking and evaluation suite
12. Migration guides from existing tools

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI Python SDK
- LangChain framework
- Anthropic Claude SDK
- Pydantic for schema validation
- pytest for testing framework
- Static analysis tools (AST, mypy integration)

## Risk Mitigation
- **Specification Burden**: Provide automated contract mining and good defaults
- **Complex Semantics**: Start with simple contracts, progressively add complexity
- **Model Compliance**: Include fallback mechanisms and alternative models
- **Performance**: Optimize with caching, selective validation, and batching
